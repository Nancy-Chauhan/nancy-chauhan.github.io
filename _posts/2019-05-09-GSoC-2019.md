This year I have got the opportunity to work with Fossi Foundation as a Google Summer of Code Student Developer 2019. 
I will be working on project <strong>Continuous Integration for Hardware Projects on LibreCores CI</strong>

<strong>Google Summer of Code</strong>

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a yearly program by Google to help the open source communities to 
reach out to student contributors. Organisations pitch projects, and when selected, pick up university students to work on 
these projects or their own ideas related to the organisationâ€™s project(s).

Librecores provides a platform to share projects and ideas, in the area of free and open source digital hardware design. 
Librecores CI is an approach/service to provide continuous integration to hardware projects hosted on Librecores to 
improve user experience and reliability. 

<strong>Project Description</strong>

This project aims to provide automation service for some hardware projects that 
have a constantly evolving code. Jenkins, the automation server will be used to achieve the goals of the project.
During the GSoC period I aim for the following deliverables:

1) Setup a pull request builder for the repository.
2) Implement a generic framework for automation of the FuseSoC-based projects.
3) Setting up a mor1kx development and verification environment.Setup of proper environment for all test cases of mor1kx.
4) Implement docker tools and pipeline library for the tools required for the verification of mor1kx (as a part of the LibreCores CI project).
5) Setup demo CI flow for mor1kx.
