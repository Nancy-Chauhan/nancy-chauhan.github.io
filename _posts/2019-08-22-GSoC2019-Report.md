## Overview
Librecores provides a platform to share projects and ideas, in the area of free and open source digital hardware design. Librecores CI is an service to provide CI for hardware projects hosted on Librecores to improve user experience and reliability.

Throughout these summers I worked on developing continuous integration for Hardware Projects like OpenRISC. OpenRISC creates free and open processor for embedded systems.

I worked on GSoC Project from May to August 2019. In this project I worked on completely different technologies (EDA tools, processors, Docker, Jenkins , Groovy DSL & Jenkins Shared library) and GitHub organizations (OpenRISC, LibreCores, Fusesoc ). In this project I worked on the following goals:
1) Recover OpenRISC CI pipelines and modify them by using standard LibreCores images
2) Optimised CI Pipelines with new test automation
3) Yosys Synthesis Metrics Parser developed and added to Librecores Standard image 
4) Integration of `Yosys Synthesis` for monitoring resource usages and published on Jenkins
5) Exported OpenRISC test results to TAP and published on Jenkins  
6) Move shared code of OpenRISC Pipelines to LibreCores Pipeline Library
7) Add TAP and Yosys code parsing & publishing steps to LibreCores Pipeline library
8) Default Pipeline for FuseSoC-based OpenRISC projects



## Community Bonding: Planning the solution
During the community bonding period, we planned over the goals of project and its timeline. My mentors guided me for existing CI pipelines and solutions 
to proceed with the project.

 

## Coding Phase 
The coding phase consisted of 3 months, in which I implemented the ideas I proposed in my GSoC Proposal. 

### First Phase 
In the first month, I mostly worked on recovering OpenRISC CI pipelines as it worked on Travis CI before. Now the the openrisc Continuous Integration (CI) suite is running in a librecores-ci-openrisc docker container.

### Second Phase 
From the second phase, we started working on optimising CI pipelines. We completed working on Yosys synthesis with changes in core desription file (fusesoc). This goal 
led to developments and changes in fusesoc backend `edalize` with its new released version ``v0.1.6 ``

### Third Phase 
The third  month was about completing Yosys Synthesis and publishing its result on <a href="https://ci.librecores.org/job/Projects/job/OpenRISC/">LibreCoresCI jenkins server </a> with plot plugin which also led to the release of new version ``0.5.0`` of LibrecoresCI standard docker image.
I also worked on exporting OpenRISC test results to TAP and published on Jenkins with Tap plugin. Finally I worked on developing Librecores Pipeline library for generalising the pipelines of OpenRISC project. 
I also worked on generalising Yosys Synthesis so that it can be used by various hardware projects with function call of ``yosysSynthesisReport(String core, String targetName, String yosysLogPath)``.

## What did I learn in GSoC
1) Various technologies i.e Docker, Jenkins 
1) Groovy Programming and developing Jenkins Shared Library
2) Concepts of DSL and Closure 
3) Learned about various EDA Tools 


## Future engagements
We are still aiming to involve more hardware projects to use generalised librecoresCI Pipeline library and tools .

Thank you Oleg Nenashev, Stafford Horne, Olofk Kindgren for helping me complete the goals for GSoC 2019.
