*HDMI technology has become the global standard for the connection of high-definition equipments. 
More than 1,700 of the world's largest consumer electronics, PC and mobile device manufacturers incorporate 
HDMI connectivity into their products as it delivers both high quality and unmatched ease of use. 
This project work aims to transmit High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and Digital Visual Interface (DVI) 
data streams to HDMI and DVI capable monitors via Spartan 6 FPGA. 
The top-level design in this project work displays a simple coloured pattern.*
