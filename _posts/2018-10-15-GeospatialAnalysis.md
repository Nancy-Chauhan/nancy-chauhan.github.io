Recently Attented The Workshop on Free and Open Source libraries of Python for Geo spatial Analysis and Visualisation(Maps and Satellite imageries) and Worked on this Project during Pycon India 2018 held in Hyderabad 

Geospatial representation are so prevalent in day to day life, such as even in simple travel related conversation to maps, aerial/satellite images etc. In digital era, geospatial data is extensively produced and consumed in ever growing proportion. Python with its free and open source libraries are giving wide variety yet simple and effective set of tools to visualise and analyse geospatial data. 

Built with Python , work with vector data and raser data
