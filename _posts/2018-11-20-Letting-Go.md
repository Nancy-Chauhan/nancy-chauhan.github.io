This is a Personal Blog about the Problem I faced in <strong>Letting Go</strong> some things ! It completely took me 6 months to 
realise that it is best to let it go ! Letting go creates space for fresh beginnings:stripping you of what happened yesterday, 
and enabling the doors of brand new opportunities to open today.

I believe Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your house, so that new joy can find space to enter. 
It shakes the yellow leaves from the bough of your heart, so that fresh green leaves can grow in their place. It pulls up 
the rotten roots, so that new roots hidden beneath have room to grow. Whatever sorrow shakes from your heart, far better
things will take their place.

I think Letting go something painful had been the best decision of my life though quite tough . It not only prepares you for 
facing storms but gives you an opportunity to fall in love with yourself more ! Cheers to all who are learning to let go off things
that are not meant to be yours !
