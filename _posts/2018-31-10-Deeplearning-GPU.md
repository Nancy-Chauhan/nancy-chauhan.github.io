Whenever we start with Deeplearning , we are bombarded with the doubts that Deep Learning requires a lot
of hardware. I have seen people training a simple deep learning model for days on
their laptops (typically without GPUs) which leads to an impression that Deep Learning requires
big systems to run execute.
