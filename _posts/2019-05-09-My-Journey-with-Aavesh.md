Aavesh is a Technical Society of Electronics and communication Engineering Department (IIIT-Una).It was founded in January 2019. With less resources and time ,
we as a team came up with wonderful output. Aavesh organised various technical events & hardware exhibition under Techincal fest Meraki 2019
One thing for which i am really feel proud of myself is being a part of team and totally starting it from scratch. To bring something into existence 
requires great amount of effort and teamwork. With the support of  Director , IIIT UNA , Prof. Selvakumar and wonderful Mentor Mr. Sumit Kumar ,and most importantly all 
team members , Aavesh became a huge success.

I believe <strong>Aavesh</strong> holds a great future and will achieve great heights. Aavesh will be holding Annual Hardware Hackathon.
To work late night on projects, to ensure to get everything done in harmony made me realized that i just learned to lead a team . 
It was the best experience of my college life.
