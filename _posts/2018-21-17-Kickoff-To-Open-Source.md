For every Developer the story of Open Source World starts with What? Why? How? What is open source, Why should we know about it ?How to get involved in it ?

<h2>What ??</h2>

Open Source is not the same as no-cost (free) software. Rather, it is idea that you can open the software to see what‚Äôs in it, manipulate it, and make it yours. It‚Äôs open to you, and that implies many more things about it that make it interesting and important.

<h2>Why ??</h2>

Why to know about it ?? These are some of the things we can experience through Open Source:<br>

 1)Get experience working in real codebases ( Isn‚Äôt Awesome ? )<br>
 2)Reading other people‚Äôs code , People from all over the world can contribute to your code.<br>

5)A very good code quality is maintained <br>

<strong>Hence contributing to open source makes you a better developer !</strong>
